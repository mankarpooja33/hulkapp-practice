## Development

I had gone through the design and the gif image shared for scroll animation. Used bootstarp to design the page. Used bootstrap for the 1st time in this project. For scroll animation, I have used css animation, traversing the JSON and rendering on page for products section was fun. I used to work on similar type of work in the early phase of my career. I first thought about the dependancies like updating cart item and subtotal based on the operations like plus, minus and delete. Created separate functions for each feature.
Chanllenging part: It was implementation of scroll animation as it took some time for me to build a code.

## Pending Items:
1. I have implemented the functionality however some cosmatic changes are remaining.(focused on achieving the functionality).
2. Change image on active color is pending as I was unable to find different color images in variants so I have used colors entries from images array.

## Thank you
